# Genshin Impact API Tutorial

This repository holds the codebase for building a simple website with the fan-made Genshin Impact API by Genshin.dev [here](https://github.com/genshindev/api).

If you're following along the tutorial, make sure that you're at the `/start` branch. But if you got lost at a certain step, feel free to have a look at `/completed` branch.

## Preview Demo

Start - with hard coded values

Yes, the design of this graphic is referenced from the namecard in game ðŸ˜† If i could, i would probably replicate it entirely just for fun but we can't retrieve player's information directly (duh)
